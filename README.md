# IdleTower


## Ideas
- Tilemap, dynamic expansion based on fog of war
- Idle defense from all angles
- Passive income based on territory
- Can convert tiles from towers/attackers into farms and infrastructure to increase passive income
- Can conquer tiles with active mission to gain more tiles
  - Have 3 cards to choose from to empower mission
  - Outcome of selected cards could remain static for the conquered tile
- When area gets too big, combine 4 squares into one as to not have miles of tiles to keep track of.
